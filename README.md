# Binary Calculator

## Overview

This project is a Binary Calculator implemented in Python. The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on binary numbers. It is designed to help users understand and perform calculations in binary, which is the fundamental language of computers.

## Features

- **Addition of binary numbers**: Add two binary numbers and get the result in binary.
- **Subtraction of binary numbers**: Subtract one binary number from another and get the result in binary.
- **Multiplication of binary numbers**: Multiply two binary numbers and get the result in binary.
- **Division of binary numbers**: Divide one binary number by another and get the result in binary.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the binary calculator:

```
First binary number: 1010
Second binary number: 0101
Operation (+, -, *, /): +
Result: 1111
```

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Installation

To install and run the binary calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binary-calculator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd binary-calculator
    ```
3. Run the Python script:
    ```
    Follow the instructions below!
    ```

## Usage

To use the binary calculator, follow these steps:

1. Uncomment the print statement on line 68
2. Enter the first binary number in the print statement
3. Enter the second binary number in the print statement
4. Enter the operation you want to perform (+, -, *, /).
5. Run the program!

P.S. You can enter a binary less than 8 digits and it will adjust automatically, but if you enter a binary bigger than 8 digits it will error
